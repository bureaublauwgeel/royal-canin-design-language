					<p>Royal Canin understand that as local markets are implementing Web Design Language features there may be issues that arise or feedback from users. Issue raising and feedback handling are documented below.</p>
				</header>
				
				<p><b>Issues</b></p>
				
				<p>Any issues may be raised via Github and will be handled via Github issues. We will aim to offer each developer the chance to review and feed into the code by raising an issue. As is standard, if an issue is deemed valid it will be addressed, fixed and will be merged into the main code base. Developers will be able to offer the issue with a fix and any fixes deemed viable and successful will be merged. A log of the fix will be made in the change log and notification sent to all subscribers.</p>

				<p><b>Feedback</b></p>
				
				<p>Design or development feedback is handled by a dedicated Slack channel. For example, you may want to provide feedback about a component that you find does not look correct in a certain context and needs updating. Or you may wish to provide feedback about an icon you have created that did not exist in the Web Design Language. Whatever it is, we encourage feedback so that together we create visibility and collaboration across our global digital assets. </p>
