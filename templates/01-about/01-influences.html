					<p>The concept of a digital style guide is not new, with some of the leading global tech companies offering influence to the Web Design Language. Google, The Lonely Planet, BBC and AIRBNB all have well established and often imitated style guides. By adopting this approach to design, the Royal Canin brand joins this group of pioneering brands in the pursuit of delivering better user experiences, and more efficient design collaboration. Below we look at some of the leading digital style guides in more detail and how they’ve offered inspiration to the Web Design Language.</p>

				<p><b>Google Material Design</b></p>
				
				<p>Adopted over a multitude of device types, Google’s Material Design aims to ‘create a visual language for our users that synthesizes the classic principles of good design with the innovation and possibility of technology and science.’ Material design has helped shape decisions made throughout the development of the Web Design Language to ensure best practice is constantly met and design styles are pushed to new levels.</p>

				<p><b>Lonely Planet Rizzo</b></p>
				
				<p>The objective of Lonely Planet Rizzo is to ensure a consistent design & development style across Lonely Planet’s global site. It adopts several key development principles that were important to ensure the Royal Canin Web Design Language is a success; maximise the re-use of components as much as possible in order to create consistency; and keep it simple. Lonely Planet Rizzo also categorises content into style elements and UI components in a way that was agreed to be necessary in the successful execution of the Royal Canin Web Design Language.</p>

				<p><b>BBC Gel</b></p>
				
				<p>Similarly to Material Design, the objective of BBC Gel is adoption across a multitude of platforms that must retain the style of the BBC whilst enabling the freedom to meet specific market needs. BBC Gel aims to ‘create consistent and delightful user experiences across all of our Digital Services.’ BBC Gel has been established over a number of years and the aim is to expand further over time. At Royal Canin we also recognise that with the support of our designers, developers and partner agencies that our Web Design Language will continue to evolve expand over time.</p>
