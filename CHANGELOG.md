 ## v5.1.0
A refinement on version 5 with the addition of some new hyperlink styles.
 ### Breaking Changes
 ##### New Hyperlink styles
We've added icons for hyperlinks that generate new pages and lead to external sites..
 ## v5.0.0
With the growing need for visual elements we've added various multimedia elements.
 ### Breaking Changes
 ##### Colour naming conventions
We've had an overhaul of how we name our colours. They're now a lot more logical and abstract.
 ### New Features
 ##### Content Blocks
Content blocks make up a large proportion of many consumer facing websites. They are one of the most powerful assets we have to create a consistent visual style to landing pages, campaigns and content. This is why we have taken the time to carefully define and develop a collection of ready to use variations of content blocks for use across Royal Canin digital projects.
 ##### 404 template
Usual page not found but with a nice animated svg image.
 ##### Media elements
We've added an array of new media elements. Including items like the <picture> element for true responsive image and parallax media elements for when a page needs a bit of extra flare.
 ##### Responsive typography
Headings now grow/shrink depending on the device/screen sizes.
 ##### Design Language tips/alerts
We've now added tip and alerts across the Design Language to highlight important information.
 ## v4.0.0
On our quest for design system utopia we are extremely happy to announce the release of a brand new website. The new site design makes it easier to get started in design and development projects, and to find exactly what you are looking for.
 ### Breaking Changes
 ##### Vertical Navigation
The vertical navigation component has been removed
 ### New Features
 ##### New Website
New layout and navigation structure
 ## v3.1.0
This release is all about improving our documentation. We have included a new section on implementation which we hope will clear up how to get your project up and running.
 ### New Features

A whole section dedicated to helping you get up and running with the Design Language. Including a downloadable HTML boilerplate.

 ## v3.0.0
Following the recent v2.0.0 update, in this release we give you another boat load of code optimisations on our journey to the land of implementation utopia. A 16 pixel icon set is now also a thing of beauty for design and development. We banished some bugs on responsive typography to the past amongst some other ghosts, ghouls and demons. And finally, whilst we canâ€™t help you find love, we can give you a long lost search feature to help you find what you are looking for.
 ### Breaking Changes
 ##### Form Elements Update
The "rc-" prefix has been removed from form input classes in order to be consistent with the rest of Design Language. Form elements now also follow BEM class naming convention.
