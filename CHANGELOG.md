 ## v4.0.0
On our quest for design system utopia we are extremely happy to announce the release of a brand new website. The new site design makes it easier to get started in design and development projects, and to find exactly what you are looking for.
 ### Breaking Changes
 ##### Vertical Navigation
The vertical navigation component has been removed
 ### New Features
 ##### New Website
New layout and navigation structure
 ## v3.1.0
This release is all about improving our documentation. We have included a new section on implementation which we hope will clear up how to get your project up and running.
 ### New Features
 ##### Implementation Pages
A whole section dedicated to helping you get up and running with the Design Language. Including a downloadable HTML boilerplate.
 ##### Readme Documentation in the Project Repository
Our readme file for developers has been updated with improved instructions.
 ##### General Layout Improvements
We are working on incremental layout improvements to the portal, the most notable in this release is the removal of the grey background.
 ### Minor Updates/Bug fixes
 ##### Slider Bug Fixes
The slider element has been improved and had some mobile bugs fixed.
 ##### Form Element Bug Fixes for Firefox/Safari
Form elements are now showing properly in latest Firefox and Safari.
 ##### Bug Fixed on Tabs Element
Fixed bug where tabs were toggling on double click.
 ## v3.0.0
Following the recent v2.0.0 update, in this release we give you another boat load of code optimisations on our journey to the land of implementation utopia. A 16 pixel icon set is now also a thing of beauty for design and development. We banished some bugs on responsive typography to the past amongst some other ghosts, ghouls and demons. And finally, whilst we canâ€™t help you find love, we can give you a long lost search feature to help you find what you are looking for.

The "rc-" prefix has been removed from form input classes in order to be consistent with the rest of Design Language. Form elements now also follow BEM class naming convention.
